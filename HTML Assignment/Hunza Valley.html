<strong><i>Hunza valley</strong></i> was formerly a princely state
bordering Xinjiang (autonomous region of
China) to the northeast and Pamir to the
northwest, which survived until 1974,
when it was finally dissolved by Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto. The state bordered the Gilgit
History
Baltit Fort, the former residence of the Mirs of Hunza
Agency to the south and the former
princely state of Nagar to the east. The
state capital was the town of Baltit (also
known as Karimabad) another old
settlement is Ganish Village which means
ancient god "Ganesh village. Hunza was
an independent principality for more than
900 years, until the British gained control
of it and the neighbouring valley of Nagar
between 1889 and 1891 through a military
conquest. The then Mir/Tham (ruler)
Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to Kashghar in
China and sought what would now be
called political asylum.

<ul   style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" ><strong>Hunza is divided into 3 geographic
subdivisions:</strong><br>
<li>Gojal Valley/Upper Hunza</li>
<li>Lower Hunza</li>
<li>Central Hunza</li>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%"> The ruling family of Hunza is called
Ayeshe (heavenly). The two states
of Hunza and Nagar were formerly
one, ruled by a branch of the
Shahreis, the ruling family of Gilgit,
whose seat of government was
Nager. First muslim came to HunzaNagar Valley some 1000 years (At
the time of Imam Islam Shah 30th
Imam Ismaili Muslims). After the
introduction of Islam to Gilgit,
married a daughter of Trakhan of
Gilgit, who bore him twin sons,
named Moghlot and Girkis. From the
former the present ruling family of
Nager is descended. The twins are
”
said to have shown hostility to one
another from birth. Thereupon their
father, unable to settle the question
of succession, divided his state
between them, giving Girkis the
north/west, and to Moghlot the
south/east bank of the river.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%">The local languages spoken include
Burushaski, Wakhi and Shina. The literacy
rate of the Hunza valley is believed to be
more than 77%. The historical area of
Hunza and present northern Pakistan has
had, over the centuries, mass migrations,
conflicts and resettling of tribes and
ethnicities, of which the Dardic Shina race
is the most prominent in regional history.
People
People of the region have recounted their
historical traditions down the generations.
The longevity of Hunza people has been
noted by some, but others refute this as
a longevity myth and cite a life expectancy
of 110 years for men and 122 for women
with a high standard deviation.[14] There is
no evidence that Hunza life expectancy is
significantly above the average of poor,
isolated regions of Pakistan. Claims of
health and long life were almost always
based solely on the statements by the
local mir (king). An author who had
significant and sustained contact with
Burusho people, John Clark, reported that
they were overall unhealthy</p><br>
