<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >
<strong><i>Swat</i></strong>is a valley and an
administrative district in the <strong><i>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</strong></i> province of Pakistan. Swat
is renowned for its outstanding natural
beauty.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >Centred upon the upper portions of the
Swat River, Swat was a major centre of
early Buddhist thought as part of the
Gandhara kingdom, and today is littered
with ruins from that era. Swat was home
to the last isolated pockets of Gandharan
Buddhism, which lasted until the 11th
century, well after most of the area had
converted to Islam.
 Until 1969, Swat was
part of the Yusafzai State of Swat, a selfgoverning princely state. The region was
seized by the Pakistani Taliban in late
2007,[5] and its tourist industry decimated
Languages (1981) 90.28% Pashto
8.67% Kohistani
until Pakistani control over Swat was reestablished in mid 2009.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%">As mentioned above, Swat lies in the lap of
mountainous ranges, which are the
offshoots of Hindukush, so the larger part
of Swat is covered with high mountains
and hills, the crests of which are hidden by
everlasting snow. Though these gigantic
ranges run irregularly: some to the west
while the others to the east, but the
general direction is North-South</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%">Gwalerai village located near Mingora is
one of those few villages which produces
18 varieties of apples due to its temperate
climate in summer. The apple produced
here is consumed in Pakistan as well as
exported to other countries. It is known as
‘the apple of Swat’.[34] Swat is famous for
peach production mostly grown in the
valley bottom plains and accounts for
about 80% of the peach production of the
country. Mostly marketed in the national
markets with a brand name of "Swat
Peaches". The supply starts from April and
continues till September because of a
diverse range of varieties grown.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%">The length of the valley from Landakay to
Gabral is 91 miles. Two narrow strips of
plains run along the banks of Swat River
from Landakay to Madyan. Beyond
Madyan in Kohistan-e-Swat, the plain is
too little to be mentioned. So far as the
width concerns, it is not similar, it varies
from place to place. We can say that the
average width is 5 miles. The widest
portion of the valley is between Barikot
and khwaza khela. The widest viewpoint
and the charming sight where a major
portion of the valley is seen is at Gulibagh
on the main road, which leads to Madyan</p>
