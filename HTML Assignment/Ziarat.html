<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%;" >How do you feel if you are roaming in a place and suddenly the clouds come down and stirred you? 
It is not impossible, indeed, if you go for a hiking of Pakistan's mountainous places, its experience can be sudden.
The clouds will come in front of the eyes that are very transparent, which can be seen, in the moments full of love is filled with the love of the country.
Do not understand what words in this word describe, but the colors of our country are just like those who win the heart.

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%"><strong><i>Ziarat</i></strong> (the capital of Ziarat District, <i><strong>Balochistan</strong></i> Province, Pakistan) is a holiday resort, about 130 km from the capital city of Balochistan province Quetta. The famous Quaid-e-Azam Residency is also there in the valley, where Quaid spent a few of his most memorable days. Tourists from all over Balochistan and also from Sindh province visit the valley in the harsh summers. Its overall cold weather, fascinating sceneries, lush green forests and mighty mountains attracts tourists of all kinds.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:Yellow;" >Tourist Areas</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%">Ziarat is the location of the Ziarat
residency where Jinnah spent the last
days of his life. The residency, constructed
in 1892, is a wooden structure with great
architectural importance. It was originally
meant to be a sanatorium, but was
converted into the summer residence of
the Agent of the Governor General. It is
now a national monument. The residency
catches tourists' attention because of its
location and hilly surroundings.<br>There is a small dam, and the valley is full
of fruits: cherry in summer and apple in
winter. Between the hills and the deep
ravine, there is a mile-long stretch of flat
land ideal for walking. This is the Chashma
Walk, which leads to the spring, or
“chashma", that provides water for the
town.<br>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%">May to September are months of peak
tourist visits. Specially in the days of Eid
festive and other national or religious the
valley is full packed. The 2016's Eid
experienced about 0.4 million people
visiting.
The hill station is easily accessible from
Quetta through a Highway. While
accessing it from Loralai is little difficult
due to bad road conditions. The third way
of accessing the valley is through Harnai
District although it is pretty dangerous
near Dumiara waterfall, due to the very
steep and unpaved road.</p>
