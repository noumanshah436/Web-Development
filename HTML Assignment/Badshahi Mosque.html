<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >
The <strong><i>Badshahi Mosque</strong></i> ("Imperial Mosque") is a
Mughal era masjid in Lahore, capital of the
Pakistani province of Punjab[1], Pakistan.
The mosque is located west of Lahore Fort
along the outskirts of the Walled City of
Lahore, and is widely considered to be
one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >Badshahi Mosque was commissioned by
Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with
construction of the mosque lasting for two
years until 1673. The mosque is an
important example of Mughal architecture,
with an exterior that is decorated with
carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It
remains the largest and most recent of the
grand imperial mosques of the Mughalera, and is the second-largest mosque in
Pakistan. After the fall of the Mughal
Empire, the mosque was used as a
garrison by the Sikh Empire and the British
Empire, and is now one of Pakistan's most
iconic sights.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(173, 173, 37);">Background</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >Lahore was considered a strategic center
as it protected the empire from potential
invaders from the west. The city was
made an imperial capital by the earlier
Emperor, Akbar, who established the
nearby Lahore Fort.
The sixth Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb,
chose Lahore as the site for his new
imperial mosque. Aurangzeb, unlike the
previous emperors, was not a major patron
of art and architecture and instead
focused , during much of his reign, on
various military conquests which added
over 3 million square kilometres to the
Mughal realm.
The mosque was built to commemorate
military campaigns against the Maratha
king Chhatrapati Shivaji, although
construction of the mosque exhausted the
Mughal treasury and weakened the
Mughal state. As a symbol of the
mosque's importance, it was built directly
across from the Lahore Fort and its
Alamgiri Gate, which was concurrently
built by Aurangzeb during construction of
the mosque.

<h2 style="background-color:Yellow;">Location</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >The mosque is located adjacent to the
Walled City of Lahore, Pakistan. The
entrance to the mosque lies on the
western side of the rectangular Hazuri
Bagh, and faces the famous Alamgiri Gate
of the Lahore Fort, which is located on the
eastern side of the Hazuri Bagh. The
mosque is also located next to the
Roshnai Gate, one of the original thirteen
gates of Lahore, which is located to the
southern side of the Hazuri Bagh.
Near the entrance of the mosque lies the
Tomb of Muhammad Iqbal, a poet widely
revered in Pakistan as the founder of the
Pakistan Movement which led to the
creation of Pakistan as a homeland for the
Muslims of British India. Also located
near the mosque's entrance is the tomb of
Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, who is credited
for playing a major role in preservation and
restoration of the mosque.</p>
