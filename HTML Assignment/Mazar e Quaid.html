<strong><i>Mazar-e-Quaid</strong></i>  ,(also
known as the Jinnah Mausoleum or the
National Mausoleum, is the final resting
place of Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader")
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of
Pakistan. Designed in a 1960s modernist
style, the mausoleum also contains the
tomb of his sister, Mader-e Millat ("Mother
of the Nation") Fatima Jinnah, and that of
Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of
Pakistan.The mausoleum was completed in 1970,
and is an iconic symbol of Karachi. The
mausoleum is one of the most popular
tourist destinations in Karachi.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:Yellow;">Significance</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >Official and military ceremonies take place
here on special occasions, such as on 23
March (Pakistan Day), 14 August

<h2 style="background-color:Yellow;">Architecture</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%" >The Mausoleum building was designed by
famous architect Yahya Merchant.
 It is made of white marble with curved Moorish
arches and copper grills reset on an
elevated 54-square-meter platform. The
mausoleum is located in a 53-hectare park
and the building has a footprint of 75 by
75 m (246 by 246 ft) with a height of 43 m
(141 ft), built on a 4 m (13 ft) high
platform. In each wall is placed an
entrance. Fifteen successive fountains
lead to the platform from one side and
from all sides terraced avenues lead to the
gates. The cool inner sanctum reflects the
green of a four-tiered crystal ch
gifted by the People's Republic of China.
Around the mausoleum is a park fitted
with strong beamed spot-lights which at
night project light on the white
mausoleum.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:140%">In the interior of the grave complex, there
are four graves in a row and one to the
north. The northern one, which is
decorated with a series of black floral
design at the base, belongs to Miss Fatima
Jinnah, Quaid-e-Azam's sister. Out of the
four graves in a row, first extreme two
belong to Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime
Minister of Pakistan and Begum Ra'ana
Liaquat Ali Khan lying side by side. The
other extreme grave belongs to Sardar
Abdur Rab Nishtar. In the middle lies
buried Nurul Amin, who rose to be the only
Vice-President of Pakistan. All these
graves are made of Italian white marble,
and they are of the box type, like the
sarcophagus of Jinnah, placed on a triple
base. But the sides of these graves are
tapering inward while that of Jinnah are
diverging outward. These are all plain
graves, except that of Mohtarma Fatima
Jinnah, which has a basal floral
ornamentation.</p><br>
