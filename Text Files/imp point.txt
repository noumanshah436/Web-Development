Do not need to remember all the programming stuff or all properties or syntax
Make your reference stuff and look at it when you implement it.

If you keep in touch with reference it will be very helpfull
but if you come again after long time suppose 10 year after ,
it will be slightly difficult to cope with at start but things will
become smoother after some time if you have your notes or references.
