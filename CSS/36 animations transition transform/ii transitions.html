    *********************
    Transition =  the process or a period of changing from one state or condition to another.

    *********************
    how to transition:

    define transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function   transition-delay 
    in the element

    and define a hover function  in which we define values of properties (like color)
    for transition

    *********************

    Transition-property- It is used to decide which transition property we want to use.
    For example,   to transition background color, 

    we can perform transition which have continues values and can move from one state to other
    like color can change from green to red or red to green or they are able to perform transition
    like color , height , font-size etc.

    *********************

    Transition-timing-function- This property is used to decide the speed of transition from beginning to end. 
    These are of three types as follows-

        ease-in
        After applying this, the animation will start slowly and becomes fast towards the end.

        ease-out
        After applying this, the animation will begin fastly and become slow towards the end.

        ease-in-out
        After applying this, the animation will start slowly, then become fast in the midway, and ends slowly.

    transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;

        transition: all 1s ease-in-out .3s;
